                <p>I am 29 years old, among my favorite things belongs: hanging out with friends either in real-world or some virtual one, exercising and of course coding!</p>
                <p>Currently, I am trying to use my time and develop various skills from playing on the guitar, getting better at the games in which some of my friends adore to laugh at me and share some of my not proudest moments worldwide and again in coding and IT skills overall.</p>

            </section>

            <section>    
                <p>In general, an ISA defines the supported instructions, data types, registers, the hardware support for managing main memory, fundamental features (such as the memory consistency, addressing modes, virtual memory), and the input/output model of a family of implementations of the ISA.</p>

            </section>

            <section>    
                <p>Is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. The architecture of a system refers to its structure in terms of separately specified components of that system and their interrelationships.</p>

                <h4>Processor design</h4>
            </section>

            <section>    
                <p>The mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate data values using registers, change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to control program flow. The design process involves choosing an instruction set and a certain execution paradigm (e.g. VLIW or RISC) and results in a microarchitecture, which might be described in e.g. VHDL or Verilog</p>
